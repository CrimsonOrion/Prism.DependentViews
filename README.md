# Prism.DependentViews

This Prism application comes from Prism Problems & Solutions: Loading Dependent Views on Pluralsight.com. It is informative, but a little outdated. This repository is updated for Prism 8, .NET 5 using DryIoC (though Unity is identical is this example), and the default System.Windows.Controls.Ribbon.
